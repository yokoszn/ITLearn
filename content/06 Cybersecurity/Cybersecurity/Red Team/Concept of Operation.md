The Concept of Operation (CONOPS) is a part of the engagement plan that details a high-level overview of the proceedings of an engagement; we can compare this to an executive summary of a penetration test report. The document will serve as a business/client reference and a reference for the red cell to build off of and extend to further campaign plans.

The CONOPS document should be written from a semi-technical summary perspective, assuming the target audience/reader has zero to minimal technical knowledge. Although the CONOPS should be written at a high level, you should not omit details such as common tooling, target group, etc. As with most red team documents, there is not a set standard of a CONOPS document; below is an outline of critical components that should be included in a CONOPS

    Client Name
    Service Provider
    Timeframe
    General Objectives/Phases
    Other Training Objectives (Exfiltration)
    High-Level Tools/Techniques planned to be used
    Threat group to emulate (if any)

# Example 1 - Holo Enterprises:

**CONOPS:**

Holo Enterprises has hired TryHackMe as an external contractor to conduct a month-long network infrastructure assessment and security posture. The campaign will utilize an assumed breach model starting in Tier 3 infrastructure. Operators will progressively conduct reconnaissance and attempt to meet objectives to be determined. If defined goals are not met, the red cell will move and escalate privileges within the network laterally. Operators are also expected to execute and maintain persistence to sustain for a period of three weeks. A trusted agent is expected to intervene if the red cell is identified or burned by the blue cell throughout the entirety of the engagement. The last engagement day is reserved for clean-up and remediation and consultation with the blue and white cell.

The customer has requested the following training objectives: assess the blue team's ability to identify and defend against live intrusions and attacks, Identify the risk of an adversary within the internal network. The red cell will accomplish objectives by employing the use of Cobalt Strike as the primary red cell tool. The red cell is permitted to use other standard tooling only identifiable to the targeted threat.
