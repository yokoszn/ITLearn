[[Cyber Security]]

consider an analogy of a web application as a planet. Astronauts travel to the planet to explore its surface, similar to how someone uses a web browser to explore or browse a web application. Although we only see the surface of a planet, a lot is going on under the surface. You can imagine the whole planet as a web server with many things going on under the surface of the web server, yet all we can usually see is the surface of web pages or apps. We will now explore the various components that make up a web application.

## Front End

The **Front End** can be considered similar to the surface of the planet, the parts that an astronaut can see and interact with based on the laws of nature. A web application would have a user interact with it and use a number of technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to do this.

**HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) is a foundational aspect of web applications. It is a set of instructions or code that instructs a web browser on what to display and how to display it. It could be compared to simple organisms living on the planet; these organisms have DNA, which is the instructions for how simple organisms are put together.

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) in web applications describes a standard appearance, such as certain colours, types of text, and layouts. Continuing the analogy with DNA, these could be compared to the parts of DNA that describe the colour, shape, size, and texture of the simple organism.

  

![Illustration of a planet symbolizing an HTML web page: gray, bare, and motionless, lacking CSS for design and JavaScript for movement.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36/room-content/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36-1725909121813.png)

**JS** (JavaScript) is part of a web application front end that enables more complex activity in the web browser. Whereas HTML can be considered a simple set of instructions on what to display, JavaScript is a more advanced set of instructions that allows choices and decisions to be made on what to display. In the planet analogy, JavaScript can be considered the brain of an advanced organism, which allows decisions to be made based on what and how something interacts with it.

  
  

## Back End

The **Back End** of a web application is things you don’t see within a web browser but are important for the web application to work. On a planet, these are the non-visual things: the structures that keep a building standing, the air, and the gravity that keeps feet on the ground.

This thriving ecosystem highlights how databases store and provide access to various types of resources essential for the planet’s (website's) functionality.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36/room-content/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36-1725909121805.png)

A **Database** is where information can be stored, modified, and retrieved. A web application may want to store and retrieve information about a visitor's preferences on what to show or not; this would be stored in a database. A planet may have more advanced inhabitants who store information about locations in maps, write notes in a diary or put books in a library and files in a filing cabinet.

  

![Illustration of a planet’s infrastructure symbolizing web servers, networking, and systems that support the web application, with interconnected networks and servers at its core.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36/room-content/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36-1725909121814.png)

There are many other **Infrastructure** components underpinning Web Applications, such as web servers, application servers, storage, various networking devices, and other software that support the web application. On a planet, these are the roads that are present, the cars that run on those roads, the fuel that powers the cars.

  

![Illustration of the planet's ozone layer representing a Web Application Firewall (WAF). The protective layer surrounds the planet, symbolizing security measures that shield the web application from external attacks and threats, ensuring its safety and integrity.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36/room-content/66c513e4445cb5649e636a36-1726065440718.png)

**WAF** (Web Application Firewall) is an optional component for web applications. It helps filter out dangerous requests away from the Web Server and provides an element of protection. This could be considered similar to how a planet's atmosphere can protect inhabitants from harmful UV rays.

  
  
  

## Summary

There are many components involved in delivering a web application. Front End components like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript focus on the experience inside the browser. Back End components such as the Web Server, Database, or WAF are the engine under the surface that enable the web application to function. This simple introduction will be built upon in the upcoming tasks.

---

Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

**Scheme**

The **scheme** is the protocol used to access the website. The most common are **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and **HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS is more secure because it encrypts the connection, which is why browsers and cyber security experts recommend it. Websites often enforce HTTPS for added protection.

**User**

Some URLs can include a user’s login details (usually a username) for sites that require authentication. This happens mostly in URLs that need credentials to access certain resources. However, it’s rare nowadays because putting login details in the URL isn’t very safe—it can expose sensitive information, which is a security risk.

**Host/Domain**

The **host** or **domain** is the most important part of the URL because it tells you which website you’re accessing. Every domain name has to be unique and is registered through domain registrars. From a security standpoint, look for domain names that appear almost like real ones but have small differences (this is called **typosquatting**). These fake domains are often used in phishing attacks to trick people into giving up sensitive info.

**Port**

The **port number** helps direct your browser to the right service on the web server. It’s like telling the server which doorway to use for communication. Port numbers range from 1 to 65,535, but the most common are **80** for HTTP and **443** for HTTPS.

**Path**

The **path** points to the specific file or page on the server that you’re trying to access. It’s like a roadmap that shows the browser where to go. Websites need to secure these paths to make sure only authorised users can access sensitive resources.

**Query String**

The **query string** is the part of the URL that starts with a question mark (?). It’s often used for things like search terms or form inputs. Since users can modify these query strings, it’s important to handle them securely to prevent attacks like **injections**, where malicious code could be added.

**Fragment**

The **fragment** starts with a hash symbol (#) and helps point to a specific section of a webpage—like jumping directly to a particular heading or table. Users can modify this too, so like with query strings, it’s important to check and clean up any data here to avoid issues like injection attacks.

### Status Line

The first line in every HTTP response is called the **Status Line**. It gives you three key pieces of info:

1. **HTTP Version**: This tells you which version of HTTP is being used.
2. **Status Code**: A three-digit number showing the outcome of your request.
3. **Reason Phrase**: A short message explaining the status code in human-readable terms.

Since we already covered HTTP Versions in Task 5, let’s focus on the **Status Codes** and **Reason Phrases** here.

### Status Codes and Reason Phrases

The **Status Code** is the number that tells you if the request succeeded or failed, while the **Reason Phrase** explains what happened. These codes fall into five main categories:

**Informational Responses (100-199)**  
These codes mean the server has received part of the request and is waiting for the rest. It’s a "keep going" signal.

**Successful Responses (200-299)**  
These codes mean everything worked as expected. The server processed the request and sent back the requested data.

**Redirection Messages (300-399)**  
These codes tell you that the resource you requested has moved to a different location, usually providing the new URL.

**Client Error Responses (400-499)**  
These codes indicate a problem with the request. Maybe the URL is wrong, or you’re missing some required info, like authentication.

**Server Error Responses (500-599)**  
These codes mean the server encountered an error while trying to fulfil the request. These are usually server-side issues and not the client’s fault.

### Common Status Codes

Here are some of the most frequently seen status codes:

**100 (Continue)**  
The server got the first part of the request and is ready for the rest.

**200 (OK)**  
The request was successful, and the server is sending back the requested resource.

**301 (Moved Permanently)**  
The resource you’re requesting has been permanently moved to a new URL. Use the new URL from now on.

**404 (Not Found)**  
The server couldn’t find the resource at the given URL. Double-check that you’ve got the right address.

**500 (Internal Server Error)**  
Something went wrong on the server’s end, and it couldn’t process your request.

### Response Headers

When a web server responds to an HTTP request, it includes **HTTP response headers**, which are basically key-value pairs. These headers provide important info about the response and tell the client (usually the browser) how to handle it.

Picture an example of an HTTP response with the headers highlighted. Key headers like `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Date` give us important details about the response the server sends back.

![HTTP response header](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1730445413416.png)  

### Required Response Headers

Some response headers are crucial for making sure the HTTP response works properly. They provide essential info that both the client and server need to process everything correctly. Here are a few important ones:

- **Date**:  
    Example: `Date: Fri, 23 Aug 2024 10:43:21 GMT`  
    This header shows the exact date and time when the response was generated by the server.
    
- **Content-Type**:  
    Example: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`  
    It tells the client what kind of content it’s getting, like whether it’s HTML, JSON, or something else. It also includes the character set (like UTF-8) to help the browser display it properly.
    
- **Server**:  
    Example: `Server: nginx`  
    This header shows what kind of server software is handling the request. It’s good for debugging, but it can also reveal server information that might be useful for attackers, so many people remove or obscure this one.
    

### Other Common Response Headers

Besides the essential ones, there are other common headers that give additional instructions to the client or browser and help control how the response should be handled.

- **Set-Cookie**:  
    Example: `Set-Cookie: sessionId=38af1337es7a8`  
    This one sends cookies from the server to the client, which the client then stores and sends back with future requests. To keep things secure, make sure cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` flag (so they can’t be accessed by JavaScript) and the `Secure` flag (so they’re only sent over HTTPS).
    
- **Cache-Control**:  
    Example: `Cache-Control: max-age=600`  
    This header tells the client how long it can cache the response before checking with the server again. It can also prevent sensitive info from being cached if needed (using `no-cache`).
    
- **Location**:  
    Example: `Location: /index.html`  
    This one’s used in redirection (3xx) responses. It tells the client where to go next if the resource has moved. If users can modify this header during requests, be careful to validate and sanitise it—otherwise, you could end up with open redirect vulnerabilities, where attackers can redirect users to harmful sites.
    

### Response Body

The **HTTP response body** is where the actual data lives—things like HTML, JSON, images, etc., that the server sends back to the client. To prevent **injection attacks** like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), always sanitise and escape any data (especially user-generated content) before including it in the response.

## Security Headers

HTTP Security Headers help improve the overall security of the web application by providing mitigations against attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and others. We will now dig deeper into the following security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy

You can use a site like [https://securityheaders.io/](https://securityheaders.io/) to analyse the security headers of any website. After the discussion in this task, you will hopefully have a better understanding of what it is reporting on.  

### [[Content-Security-Policy]] (CSP)

A CSP header is an additional security layer that can help mitigate against common attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Malicious code could be hosted on a separate website or domain and injected into the vulnerable website. A CSP provides a way for administrators to say what domains or sources are considered safe and provides a layer of mitigation to such attacks.

Within the header itself, you may see properties such as `default-src` or `script-src` defined and many more. Each of these give an option to an administrator to define at various levels of granularity, what domains are allowed for what type of content. The use of self is a special keyword that reflects the same domain on which the website is hosted.

Looking at an example CSP header:

`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.tryhackme.com; style-src 'self'`

We see the use of:

- **default-src**  
    - which specifies the default policy of self, which means only the current website.  
      
    
- **script-src**  
    - which specifics the policy for where scripts can be loaded from, which is self along with scripts hosted on `https://cdn.tryhackme.com`  
      
    
- **style-src**  
    - which specifies the policy for where style CSS style sheets can be loaded from the current website (self)  
    

  

### Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

The HSTS header ensures that web browsers will always connect over HTTPS. Let's look at an example of HSTS:

`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`

  
Here’s a breakdown of the example HSTS header by directive:  

- **max-age**  
    - This is the expiry time in seconds for this setting  
      
    
- **includeSubDomains**  
    - An optional setting that instructs the browser to also apply this setting to all subdomains.  
      
    
- **preload  
    **- This optional setting allows the website to be included in preload lists. Browsers can use preload lists to enforce HSTS before even having their first visit to a website.

### X-Content-Type-Options

The X-Content-Type-Options header can be used to instruct browsers not to guess the MIME time of a resource but only use the Content-Type header. Here’s an example:

`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

Here’s a breakdown of the X-Content-Type-Options header by directives:

- **nosniff**  
    - This directive instructs the browser not to sniff or guess the MIME type.

### Referrer-Policy

This header controls the amount of information sent to the destination web server when a user is redirected from the source web server, such as when they click a hyperlink. The header is available to allow a web administrator to control what information is shared.  Here are some examples of Referrer-Policy:

- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
- `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

Here’s a breakdown of the Referrer-Policy header by directives:

- **no-referrer**  
    - This completely disables any information being sent about the referrer  
      
    
- **same-origin**  
    - This policy will only send referrer information when the destination is part of the same origin. This is helpful when you want referrer information passed when hyperlinks are within the same website but not outside to external websites.  
      
    
- **strict-origin**  
    - This policy only sends the referrer as the origin when the protocol stays the same. So, a referrer is sent when an HTTPS connection goes to another HTTPS connection.  
      
    
- **strict-origin-when-cross-origin**  
    - This is similar to strict-origin except for same-origin requests, where it sends the full URL path in the origin header.
