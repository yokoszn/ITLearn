## Instructions

### Case Scenario

1. As the Linux Administrator for fast-growing company, you have been tasked with creating, modifying, and removing user accounts from the Linux server. The company has just hired 9 new employees to fill 3 newly designed departments. The departments that have been created are Engineering, Sales and IS. The server must be setup with the appropriate files, folders, users, groups and permissions to ensure a successful launch of the newly designed departments.

### Objectives

- Create a directory at the root (/) of the file system for each department. This name should reflect the department name that will use the directory.
    
- Create a group for each department. This name should reflect the department name that the group will be assigned.
    
- Create an administrative user for each of the departments.
    
    - The user will have a Bash login shell.
    - The user will belong to the respective group for each department. This will need to be the user’s primary group.
        
- Create two additional users for each department.
    
    - The users will have a Bash login shell.
    - The users will belong to their respective group for each department. This will need to be the user’s primary group.
        
- For security reasons, the following modifications will need to be made to each of the departments' respective directories:
    
    - Ensure that the owner of each of the directories is the department administrator and the group ownership is the group for each department.
    - The department administrator will have full access to their respective department directories.
    - Ensure that only the owner of a file in the department’s directory can delete the file. The user will also have ownership of their respective department folders.
    - Normal users in each department will have full access (Read, Write and Execute) to their respective department folders.
    - The department folders will ONLY be accessible by users/administrators in each of the respective departments. Ensure that no one else will have permissions to the folders.
        
- Create a document in each of the department directories.
    
    - The ownerships on this file will be the same as the directory it is located in.
    - The document should contain only one line of text that states, “This file contains confidential information for the department.”
    - This file can be read by any user in the department, but can only be modified by the department administrator. No one else has permissions to this file.
