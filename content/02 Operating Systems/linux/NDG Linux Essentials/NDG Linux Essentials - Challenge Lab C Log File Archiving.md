## Instructions

### Case Scenario

There has been suspicious activity on the system. In order to preserve log information, it will be necessary to archive the current files in `/var/log` ending with the `.log` extension. The files are to be saved to a file named `log.tar`, stored in the directory, `~/archive`.

It has also been requested that the files that were archived be saved to a directory, `~/backup`.

### Objectives

- Create an archive named `log.tar` that is stored in the archive directory located in the home directory.
- Remove path names from the files that are archived.
- Produce verbose output while archiving.
- List the contents of the archive without extracting.
- Extract the files to the directory, `~/backup`.

### Curriculum Resources

- Module 6 - Getting Help

- Module 8 - Managing Files and Directories
- Module 9 - Archiving and Compression

### Deliverables

- Provide the final commands for successful completion.
- Provide screen captures of the commands required to complete the tasks.
- The final result of the archive listing should match the following:
```
alternatives.log
auth.log
bootstrap.log
cron.log
dpkg.log
kern.log
mail.log
```
The final result of the listing of the `backup` directory should match the following:
```

alternatives.log  bootstrap.log  dpkg.log  mail.log
auth.log          cron.log       kern.log
